# AgrivoltaicSolarPanels

This type of solar panel is possible to place over crops. The cost is a bit higher as they need to be placed on poles high over the crops. They are also a bit larger to represent the extra space they need to be able to share the solar energy.

They have 1x1 size but are drawn as 5x5 in transparent style to signify their height and to be able to see the crops below.

For more info see the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrivoltaic]Wiki on how it works but basically plants and panels share the same area.
